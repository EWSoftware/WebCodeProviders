Welcome to the **Web Code Providers** project.

This project contains a couple of custom code providers for ASP.NET web projects that can generate XML comments
files for all code in the project.

This project used to be part of the [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) project.
However, it appears that XML comments file generation is now part of many of the web project templates so it has
been moved into its own standalone project and is no longer distributed with the help file builder.

For more information, see the [Documenting Web Projects documentation](https://ewsoftware.github.io/EWSoftwareCodeDom).
